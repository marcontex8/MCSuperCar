TODO
- fix log system

- now the element list in GUI is implemented using model-view framework of Qt.
	This cause a huge number of calls to the data() funcion in SimulationElementListModel.
	The problem is that the access to the simulationWorld data is exclusive, and so each call to data() is blocking.

- world->getElementAtIndex, should be checked because it uses a lot of space and time.

- introduce shared lock in order to allowa for concurrent read access of data, while exclusive writing access

- use cmake to set the shader files position for reading and compiling

DEVELOPMENTS AREAS
- Crearte OpenGL visualizer for the simulation world

- Create custom simulation object that use inheritance from a common virtual class, and provide methods to simulate their behaviour and management.

- Improve Qt GUI, introducing custom model-view modules that takes care of displaying and controlling each element (for now Controller, World).
		This would improve the modularity of the program and it's maintainability.

- Introduce controllers to interact with each simulation element.

- Move all the required external code inside the "External" folder, in order to obtain a standalone version of the program.

- Improve robustness of CMake, allowing for a stable compilation of the program in different environments
