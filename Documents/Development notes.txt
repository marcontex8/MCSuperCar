TODO

- modify elements id mechanism, leaving the id choice to the simulated world class.

- use smart pointer!

- use FileSystem class (c++17), for accessing files!

- insert a call to std::this_thread::get_id() for each new thread in order to identiy them

- check results of shaders and textures compilation in order to make setup process stable! 

DEVELOPMENTS AREAS

- Introduce controllers to interact with each simulation element.

- Move all the required external code inside the "External" folder, in order to obtain a standalone version of the program.

- Improve robustness of CMake, allowing for a stable compilation of the program in different environments
